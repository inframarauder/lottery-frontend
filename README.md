# lottery-frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Lottery contract is deployed to the [Rinkeby test network](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/).
Source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/subhasis020299/simple-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/Lottery.sol)

This is a very basic react frontend. Will enhance it later.
